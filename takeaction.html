    <div class="topCenter">This seems to be a big problem, so what can we do? The first thing is to develop agricultural techniques that won't damage the land as much.This is mostly for people who want to focus or are focusing in agriculture, but what about the rest of us?  </div>
    <div class = "suggestion"> We have to stay educated about this. We can plant trees in cleared areas or donate to organizations that make stopping deforestations a priority. Below are a couple of organizations that specialize in this:  
    <a href="https://amazonwatch.org/">Amazon Watch</a>
    <a href="https://www.amazonteam.org/"> Amazon Team </a>
    <a href="https://www.rainforesttrust.org/">Rainforest Trust </a>
    </div>
    <div class = "everyday"> For everyday use, we can limit the amount of paper we use up, use certified wood products, limit the amount of palm oil we consume, and plant trees when we can. These small changes can and will make a difference.
