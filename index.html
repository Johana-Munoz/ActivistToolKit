  <div class = "question1">What exactly is deforestation? It is when trees are removed from an area in order to occupy that land. People often use that land to farm, build infrastructure, cattle ranching, or to mine. The increasing demand for palm oil - an oil used to make vegetable oil, lipstick, shampoos, etc - led to more trees being cut down. One of the most common methods is the "slash and burn". People will burn down the trees in a specific area so that the ashes can fertilize the land, but that will only last a few years.

    </div> 

  <div id = "side">Why is it a bad thing? With so many trees getting cut down, the carbon dioxide levels are increasing. Trees are essential for storing carbon dioxide which is important, especially with climate change and global warming. As well as, when removing the trees, greenhouse gases are released. Many animals are losing their homes and running a high level of extinction. Families near forests would rely on trees for "firewood, timber, and charcoal, but with trees being purposefully burned down, the land remains unused. Families have to travel a longer distance in order to reach the trees. Trees can also affect the quality of the water nearby as freshwater comes from watersheds. 
</div>
<div id = "location"> Deforestation is mainly happening in the tropics. People are building roads to places that were not available to us before. The building of roads leads to the removal of trees in those areas.
